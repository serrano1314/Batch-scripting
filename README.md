# Batch-scripting
This mini project is made to read a text file that contains a PATH Environments only in one line that is delimited by ; (semicolor)
and then, it will make another text file that contains each PATH and separated by a new line,
so it will easy to read

FOR EXAMPLE;
in backup_path.txt it contains like this:
C:\Users\serrano\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\;C:\Users\serrano\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts\;C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Intel\Shared Libraries\redist\intel64\compiler;

while in another.txt file, it must contain like this:
C:\Users\serrano\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\;
C:\Users\serrano\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts\;
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Intel\Shared Libraries\redist\intel64\compiler;
